# Hawaii Weather
<br><br>
Planning a trip to the lovely Hawaiian islands? Can you take the heat? <br>Launch the app.py to explore an API of Hawaiian weather data from January 2010 to August 2017 
<br><br>
API's not your thing? <br>The climate_started notebook has analyses of temperature and precipitation data. It even has data on the weather stations so you can chose to follow one that's on Kona, or wherever you're going. <br>Enjoy!
